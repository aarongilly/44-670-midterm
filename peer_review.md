# Peer Review: 

As part of the midterm, we are taking the opportunity to review work done by others in our class. I am looking at [Brett Neely's work on the same dataset](https://github.com/bncodes19/ml-classification-neely/blob/main/model.ipynb).

## Feedback

### Clarity & Organization 
(Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)

> Brett's work is structured much like my own - the sections are lined up with the suggested (/required) layout. Brett let's his Python blocks do most of the talking, which frankly I **really like**. My own work is far too wordy. The fact that I am able to follow Brett's work so easily also makes me realize I probably did too many things in my own work (for example: replacing the 1-character codes with the words they represent). Turns out doing that isn't actually necessary when it comes to telling the story. 

### Feature Selection & Justification 
(Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)

> For Brett's ML model he chose `odor` and `bruises`. These choices were very successful in producing a classifier with high predictive power. They make a ton of sense given how the different values line up so well with the different values of the target feature, `poisonous`. 

### Model Performance & Comparisons 
(Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)

> The graphics in Brett's notebook are currently broken, but the textual results are still there. When it comes to comparisons, Brett includes a paragraph comparing his results between the Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models. Personally would like to have to seen a bit more analysis done. The explanation that Random Forest performed better because it's designed to work well with non-linear relationships is clear. I would have liked to see other feature sets evaluated.  

### Reflection Quality 
(Are insights well thought out?)

> Brett's insights are pithy and straightforward. They are matter-of-fact and all spot on. You can't argue with any of the conclusions he's has drawn, but also I would have liked to hear more about the process, what he's learned from the experience, and more details on why he chose the features he did and took the steps he took.
